Paths:
This is a polyrepo containing several subprojects around stock-screening. The main project is called FINS, a Python project that has "fins/" as it's project root - full path: /r/priv/stock-screener/fins/ 
For now you can ignore all code outside the "/r/priv/stock-screener/fins/" directory tree.

Before executing anything, make sure to be in the project root /r/priv/stock-screener/fins/
To run the CLI application use 'fins' in '/r/priv/stock-screener/fins/'. That's the normative runner.

Example run command:
./fins -c "AAPL + MSFT + 7x GOOG"

Architecture: 
Dependencies follow a DAG. On the root are the entities. DSL and its operators build on top of entities. Formatters build on top of entities. Clients (e.g. CLI or API) build on top of formatters and DSL.
