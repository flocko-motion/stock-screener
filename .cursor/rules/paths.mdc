This is a polyrepo containing several subprojects around stock-screening. The main project is called FINS, a Python project that has "fins/" as it's project root - full path: /r/priv/stock-screener/fins/ 
For now you can ignore all code outside the "/r/priv/stock-screener/fins/" directory tree.

To run the CLI application use 'fins' in 'fins/'. That's the normative runner.
